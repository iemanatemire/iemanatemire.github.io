    </div>
    <p>
        Developed new features for a multi-tenant web app used for archiving and searching through video files that contained GPS data.
        Users could upload geospatial videos (embedded GPS data in video KLV) and view them with geographic context (video and map, side-by-side; showed camera location, FOV, etc).
        Supported geospatial video reporting, allowing users to define geographic regions and produce reports pertaining to the video taken in those regions (time in area, area covered, etc), plus insight and statistics.
        Saved customers hundreds of hours of digging through videos stored on hard media by returning geographic video matches in seconds.
        The main technologies used were JavaScript, Python (Flask), PostgreSQL, PostGIS, nginx, Ansible, and a smattering of AWS services.

    <h2>Personal Stuff</h2>
    <p>
        I grew up in Western PA, where I delivered newspapers as a kid and played bass in band called Garage Sale.
        I spent six years in the Air Force working as a Korean translator, used the G.I. bill to study rocks and math at Penn State, applied myself to get into working in software, then moved to Colorado for the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to spend a lot of time outdoors (hiking, biking, camping, and SCUBA).
        I brew beer, play soccer, noodle on acoustic guitar, speak Korean fluently, and run a popular <a href="https://www.meetup.com/longmont-board-games-and-beer">board game Meetup</a> in Longmont, CO.
        I have too many computers, bicycles, snowboards, guitars, dictionaries, and board games.
